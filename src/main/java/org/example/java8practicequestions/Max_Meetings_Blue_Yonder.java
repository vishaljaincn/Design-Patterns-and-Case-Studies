Problem Statement:
Given time intervals determine if a person could attend all meetings: Given an array of meeting time
intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],â€¦] (si < ei), determine if a person could
attend all meetings.

Solution Approach:
1. Sort all meetings by their start time
2. Check if any meeting starts before the previous one ends (which indicates an overlap)
3. If any overlap is found, return false (cannot attend all meetings)
4. If no overlaps are found, return true (can attend all meetings)

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(1) for in-place sort (excluding input)

Example:
Meetings: [[1,5], [6,10], [11,15], [5,9]]
After sorting: [[1,5], [5,9], [6,10], [11,15]]
Overlap check: Meeting [6,10] starts at 6 which is before [5,9] ends - overlap detected!
Result: Cannot attend all meetings
